# Gotta Grade 'em all!

It will only work if you're on your claimed submissions tab! Once you are, just click the "G" icon in your extensions bar (I couldn't be bothered to make a custom icon, if you want to, feel free to submit one, I'd love it!) and all of the currently shown submissions will open in seperate tabs. They will automatically be in the correct chronological order, from right to left. As you close each tab, the next one in line will automatically be selected.

### Installation instructions
